/*Certainly, here's a step-by-step sequence of commands from the beginning for setting up a Git repository, resolving the "non-fast-forward" error, and pushing changes to the main branch on GitHub:

Navigate to the Parent Directory of Your Project:

Open Git Bash and navigate to the parent directory of your project or the folder you want to version control. Replace /path/to/your/project with your actual project path: */


cd /path/to/your/project

/*Initialize a New Git Repository:

If you haven't already initialized a Git repository in your project folder, you can do so with the following command:*/


git init

/*Add Your Files and Commit Locally:

Add all your files and folders to the staging area, and commit them with an initial message:*/

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"


//Add a Remote for Your GitHub Repository:

/*You can do so with this command if you haven't added a remote connection to your GitHub repository. Replace yourusername with your GitHub username and node-js with the name of your GitHub repository:*/


git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/node-js.git

/*Pull Changes from GitHub's main Branch:

Pull the latest changes from the remote main branch into your local main branch:*/


git pull origin main

//If there are any conflicts, Git will prompt you to resolve them.

//Resolve Conflicts (if any):

/*If Git reports conflicts during the pull, open the conflicted files, resolve the conflicts manually, save the changes, and then commit the resolved files:*/


git add .        
git commit -m "Resolve conflicts in main branch"


//Push Your Changes to GitHub:

//After resolving conflicts (if any), push your local main branch to GitHub:


git push origin main

/*By following these steps, you should be able to initialize a Git repository, resolve the "non-fast-forward" error, and successfully push your project's contents to the main branch on GitHub.*/
